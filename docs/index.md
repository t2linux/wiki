A list of those devices can be found [on Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862).

# Getting started

To get started with an installation, refer to the [roadmap](https://wiki.t2linux.org/roadmap).

## Distributions

Different distributions are maintained by different people in their own repositories.
If the distribution you want to use has a guide [here](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/overview/), it's recommended to follow it instead of the instructions given in one of the repositories or otherwise official documentation by distribution vendor, as it considers T2 support.

## Guides and similar

Note that, if you are using one of the distributions listed above, you should follow their install guides rather than the ones listed under this section. However, they might still be important to gain a better general picture or to help with specific issues.
