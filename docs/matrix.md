# Privacy Policy — Discord–Matrix Bridge

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Privacy Policy describes how data is handled when using the Discord–Matrix bridge (“the Bridge”). The Bridge enables message synchronization between a Matrix room hosted on our infrastructure and a corresponding Discord server or channel.

This policy applies solely to the operation of the Bridge and the Matrix-side infrastructure operated by us. It does not govern Discord’s own services or data handling practices.

## 2. Matrix-Side Infrastructure

The Matrix homeserver and bridge services are self-hosted on infrastructure located in South Korea and are operated by us.

We do not collect, analyze, profile, or monetize user data. Data is processed only to the extent technically necessary to provide message delivery between Matrix and Discord.

## 3. Data Processed

The Bridge may transiently process the following data solely for message synchronization purposes:

- Message content
- Message timestamps
- Sender identifiers (usernames, IDs, or Matrix IDs as required for bridging)
- Room or channel identifiers

No additional personal data is intentionally collected.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- The Bridge does not retain logs, message content, or metadata beyond what is required for normal Matrix server operation and real-time message delivery.
- No separate databases, analytics systems, or long-term archives are maintained by the Bridge operator.

Any data stored as part of standard Matrix room history is subject to the configuration and retention policies of the Matrix homeserver.

## 5. Discord Data Handling

Messages that are bridged to Discord are transmitted to Discord’s infrastructure and are thereafter processed in accordance with Discord’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

We have no control over how Discord stores, processes, or retains data once it reaches Discord’s systems.

## 6. Data Sharing

- No data is shared with third parties other than Discord as an inherent function of the bridge.
- No data is sold, sublicensed, or disclosed for advertising, analytics, or tracking purposes.

## 7. Legal Basis

Data processing performed by the Bridge is limited to what is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of enabling cross-platform communication between Matrix and Discord.

## 8. User Awareness

By participating in a bridged room, users acknowledge that:

- Messages sent on Matrix may appear on Discord, and
- Messages sent on Discord may appear on Matrix, subject to the respective platform’s policies and technical limitations.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in infrastructure, legal requirements, or bridge functionality. Material changes will be communicated where reasonably possible.

## 10. Contact

For questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the operation of the Bridge, please contact the server administrators.
