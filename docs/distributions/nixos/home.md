# Home

Welcome to the NixOS on T2 Linux wiki! To get started, head over to [the installation guide](./installation.md).

If you have any questions, consult the [FAQ](./faq.md) to see if anything there helps. [Our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/68MRhQu) is also open; feel free to ask questions in the `#nixos` channel there.

## New to NixOS?

NixOS is not exactly an easy Linux distribution to use. If you are entirely new to Linux or had no prior experience with Nix, we strongly recommend you choose another distro like [Fedora](../fedora/home.md) first. Should you decide to proceed further, the [Nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable), [Zero-to-Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/), [NixOS Options Search](https://search.nixos.org/options) and [the official Nix wiki](https://nix.dev) could come in handy.

That said, if you know what you're doing, feel free to help us out! You know where to find us.
