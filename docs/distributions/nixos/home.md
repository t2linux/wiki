Welcome to the NixOS on T2 Linux wiki! To get started, head over to [the installation guide](./installation.md).

If you have any questions, consult the [FAQ](./faq.md) to see if anything there helps. [Our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/68MRhQu) is also open; feel free to ask questions in the `#nixos` channel there.

## New to NixOS?

NixOS is not the easiest Linux distribution to use. If you are entirely new to Linux or have no prior experience with Nix, we strongly recommend you choose another distro like [Fedora](../fedora/home.md) first. Should you decide to proceed further, the [Nixpkgs manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable), [Zero-to-Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/), [NixOS Options Search](https://search.nixos.org/options) and [the official Nix wiki](https://nix.dev) could come in handy.

Note that since T2 devices require kernel patches, you will need to build the Linux kernel quite often. This can be circumvented by [using a substituter.](faq.md#substituter-setup)

That said, if you know what you're doing, feel free to help us out! You know where to find us.
