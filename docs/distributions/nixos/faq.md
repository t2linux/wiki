# The LiveCD does not boot/only shows a blank screen

This situation occurred due to regressions in the bootloader, which the wider NixOS community was also affected.
The bug has been fixed. Make sure you are using ISOs tagged at or newer than `6.4.9-2`. Nevertheless, usage of [the latest ISO](https://github.com/t2linux/nixos-t2-iso/releases/latest) is recommended.
