# Option 1: Docker - All Linux Distros

First, you need to ensure that docker isn't using `overlay` or `overlay2` filesystems. This can be verified by running `docker info`. And will be shown next to `Storage Driver`.

In the event that you are running `overlay`, [Look at this docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/vfs-driver/) on how to switch to VFS.

*Note, this doesn't work on OSX or Windows, I am working closely with the Manjaro Devs on this one.*

**Quick Docker Install Script - For Linux**

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPyke3/mbp-manjaro/master/build-in-docker.sh")"
```

**Docker Command**

```sh
docker run --privileged \
          -v ~/manjaro-mbp-iso:/root/out \
          -v {PATH-TO-REPO}:/root/iso-profiles\
          --env KERNEL=linux57-mbp\
          --env EDITION=gnome\
          jpyke3/mbp-manjaro-buildiso
```

## Command Breakdown

- `--privileged`
    - This is required for allowing the filesystems to be created. (This is a security risk! Read for yourself the documentation on this flag)
- `-v`
    - Create a folder on your host filesystem to retrieve the compiled files from the container
    - Ensure that `{PATH-TO-REPO}` is replaced by the absolute path to this repo's files.
- `--env`
    - There are two environment variables:
        - `KERNEL`: This is used for defining which kernel version to use. All packages will follow the `-mbp` naming scheme.
        - `EDITION`: This is used for defining which edition of manjaro you would like to install.

# Option 2: Manually on an existing Manjaro Install

First Install Manjaro Tools:

```sh
pamac install manjaro-tools-iso git
```

Clone the repository to your home directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JPyke3/mbp-manjaro ~/iso-profiles
```

run a command corrisponding to your preferred version of Manjaro:

```sh
buildiso -f -p {edition} -k linux57-mbp
```

*Available Options are:*

```plain
architect gnome kde nxd xfce awesome bspwm-mate cinnamon i3 lxqt openbox webdad bspwm budgie deepin lxde mate ukui
```

## File Locations

Navigate to the directory for your iso file. If you are using the official edition, go to:

```sh
cd /var/cache/manjaro-tools/iso/manjaro/{NAME_OF_EDITION}/20.0.3/
```

If you are using the community edition:

```sh
cd /var/cache/manjaro-tools/iso/community/{NAME_OF_EDITION}/20.0.3/
```
