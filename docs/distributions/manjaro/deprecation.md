# When will Manjaro be deprecated?

For ISO, until the end of 2022. No support for installation will be provided starting from 2023. If you want to install Manjaro on your Mac after 2022, you're on your own.

For kernel for existing installation, until the end of 2023. LTS will be supported longer for those who can't switch for whatever reason.
