# Why is Manjaro T2 deprecated? :octicons-stop-16:

Due to [concerns](https://github.com/arindas/manjarno), Manjaro T2 is deprecated.
If you want to maintain it yourself, come to our Discord and we will help.

# What distro should I use instead?

We recommend [EndeavourOS :simple-endeavouros:](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/endeavouros/installation/)

# What do I do after Manjaro is deprecated?

No support for installation will be provided starting from 2023. If you want to install Manjaro on your Mac after 2023, you're on your own.

For kernel for existing installation, until the end of 2023. LTS will be supported longer for those who can't switch for whatever reason.
