# Installing alongside Windows

If you already have Bootcamp installed, you might notice that the boot option for Bootcamp instead boots you into Ubuntu. This is because GRUB automatically shares with a Windows installation. Follow [this guide on triple booting](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/windows/#if-windows-is-installed-first) to get Windows working again.

# Why isn't sound working?

Due to issues in the mbp-ubuntu install process, there is no sound working after install. You'll have to set it up manually.
Refer to this guide on [audio configuration](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/audio-config).
