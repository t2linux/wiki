If you already have Bootcamp installed, you might notice that the boot option for Bootcamp instead boots you into Fedora. This is because GRUB automatically shares with a Windows installation. Follow [this guide on triple booting](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/windows/#if-windows-is-installed-first) to get Windows working again.

This may be due to differences between USB-C to USB-A adapters. Try a different one if it is not working.
