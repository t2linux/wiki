# Download the latest safe release

Many thanks to Mike for building. You can download a live iso from Mikeeq [here](https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora).

If you need a more updated kernel, use the iso from [sharpenedblade](https://github.com/t2linux/fedora-iso/releases). Remember to follow the [Wi-Fi guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi-bluetooth/).

# Hardware Requirements

-   USB-C to USB adapter. Important: different USB-C to USB adapters work differently - if you're stuck before getting to the graphical UI during boot this may be the problem.

# Install Procedure

1. Follow the [Pre-Install](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/preinstall) guide.
2. Use the installer like normal until you get to the partitioning step.
3. Click on automatic partitioning, then click *create free space*
4. Delete the partition you created using macOS for Linux.
5. Continue with the rest of the installation.
6. Once it's finished, you can reboot without your installation media. Hold down Option (‚å•) while booting, then select EFI Boot and press enter.
7. Welcome to Fedora! :)
8. Once you're booted and in your desktop, set up [Wi-Fi](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi-bluetooth/) to finish the installation.

## Installing unsupported spins

1. Follow the installation instructions above, but use your custom (vanilla) ISO. You need an external keyboard and mouse.
2. Add our DNF repo: `sudo dnf copr enable sharpenedblade/t2linux`
3. Install our packages: `sudo dnf install t2linux-config && sudo dnf upgrade kernel`
