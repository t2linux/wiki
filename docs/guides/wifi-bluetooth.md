# Introduction

This page is a step by step guide to get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth working on T2 Macs. This guide is also applicable to **iMac19,1** and **iMac19,2**, which are T1 Intel Macs. This guide is NOT applicable for rest T1 and older Intel Macs.

!!! Warning "Arch/EndeavourOS"
    If you're running Arch or EndeavourOS and have `apple-bcm-firmware` installed, you do not need to follow this guide.

## Ensure Kernel Supports OTP Firmware Selection

Check if this command outputs any lines: `modinfo brcmfmac | grep 4387` If it doesn't output anything, then upgrade your kernel.

Refer to the "Updating Kernel" section on your distro's FAQ for instructions if you need to update your kernel:

- [Arch](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/arch/faq/#updating-kernel)
- [Fedora](https://github.com/t2linux/fedora?tab=readme-ov-file#instalation)
- [Manjaro](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/manjaro/faq/#updating-kernel)
- [Ubuntu](https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Debian-and-Ubuntu-Kernel?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-apt-repo)

## Setting up

We now use a script which can help you set up Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Click [here](../tools/firmware.sh) to download the script.

There are 4 methods supported by this script to get firmware for Linux, named as **Method 1-4** in this guide. Details of each method are given in the [On macOS](#on-macos) and [On Linux](#on-linux) section.

**Method 1-3** require macOS installed on your Mac. The initial steps of these methods are to be followed on macOS, and later steps have to be followed on Linux. Thus, if you choose one of these methods, you first need to follow the [On macOS](#on-macos) section and then proceed to the [On Linux](#on-linux) section.

**Method 4** does not require macOS, so you can directly follow the [On Linux](#on-linux) section if you choose it.

!!! Tip "macOS Removed after installing Linux"
    In case you have removed macOS after installing Linux, and need the firmware, **Method 4** is the only option for you.

### On macOS

Run the script on the macOS terminal. After you run the script, it will ask you to choose between 3 methods to move firmware to Linux:

=== "Method 1"
    **Method 1: Run the same script on Linux**

    If you choose this method, unlike **Method 2** and **Method 3**, you need not have any specific dependency already installed on your Mac. So if you don't want to install any additional software on macOS, this method is the only option for you.

    In this method, the script will copy the firmware to your **EFI** partition.

    To retrieve the firmware from **EFI** partition in Linux, you shall have to run the same script on Linux. You have 2 options do so, described in detail in [On Linux](#on-linux) section.

=== "Method 2"
    **Method 2: Create a tarball of the firmware and extract it to Linux**

    If you choose this method, the script will install the following dependencies, if missing, on macOS:

    1. **python3** - Renames the firmware and creates the tarball.

    The script shall automatically detect if any dependency is missing, and if required, will give you the option of installing it. So you need not worry about not having any dependencies installed.

    Once the script confirms that you have the necessary dependencies installed, it shall create a tarball of the firmware by the name of `firmware.tar` in your **Downloads** folder.

    Now you have to extract the firmware in the tarball to Linux. The procedure has been described in detail in [On Linux](#on-linux) section.

=== "Method 3"
    **Method 3: Create a Linux specific package which can be installed using a package manager**

    If you choose this method, the script will install the following dependencies, if missing, on macOS:

    1. **python3** - Renames the firmware.
    2. **dpkg** - Creates a package that can be installed on Linux using `apt`.
    3. **rpm** - Creates a package that can be installed on Linux using `dnf`.
    4. **makepkg** - Creates a package that can be installed on Linux using `pacman`.
    5. **coreutils** - Additional requirement of **makepkg**.

    The script shall automatically detect if any dependency is missing, and if required, will give you the option of installing it. So you need not worry about not having any dependencies installed.

    Once the script confirms that you have the necessary dependencies installed, it shall create a package of the firmware which can be installed by `apt`, `dnf` or `pacman`, depending on the option you chose while running the script. The package shall be saved in your **Downloads** folder.

    Now you have to install the package in Linux using your package manager. The procedure has been described in detail in [On Linux](#on-linux) section.

### On Linux

Once you have run the script on macOS, depending on the method you chose, the steps to be followed on Linux are described below:

=== "Method 1"
    **Method 1: Run the same script on Linux**

    Now we need to retrieve the firmware from the **EFI** partition. You further have 2 options to do so:

    === "Option 1"

        In this option, you have to run the firmware script on Linux. You run it with:

        ```bash
        bash /path/to/firmware.sh
        ```

        After you run the script, you have to choose the **"Retrieve the firmware from EFI"** option. After choosing that option, the script will install the firmware on Linux.

        !!! note

            Replace `/path/to/firmware.sh` with the actual path of the script. For example, if the script is in the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be `bash $HOME/Downloads/firmware.sh`

    === "Option 2"

        In this option, you simply have to run the following commands in Linux:

        ```bash
        sudo mkdir -p /tmp/apple-wifi-efi
        sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/apple-wifi-efi
        bash /tmp/apple-wifi-efi/firmware.sh
        sudo umount /tmp/apple-wifi-efi
        ```

        After you run the above commands, you have to choose the **"Retrieve the firmware from EFI"** option. After choosing that option, the script will install the firmware on Linux.

        This option shall be useful if you are unable to copy the script to Linux.

=== "Method 2"
    **Method 2: Create a tarball of the firmware and extract it to Linux**

    Now we shall extract the tarball of the firmware which was saved in the **Downloads** folder in macOS as `firmware.tar`. In order to do so, copy `firmware.tar` to Linux and extract the firmware to `/lib/firmware/brcm` by running:

    ```bash
    sudo tar -v -xC /lib/firmware/brcm -f /path/to/firmware.tar
    ```

    !!! note

        Replace `/path/to/firmware.tar` with the actual path of the tarball. For example, if `firmware.tar` is copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be `sudo tar -v -xC /lib/firmware/brcm -f $HOME/Downloads/firmware.tar`

    Then reload the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers by running:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac_wcc
    sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac
    sudo modprobe brcmfmac
    sudo modprobe -r hci_bcm4377
    sudo modprobe hci_bcm4377
    ```

=== "Method 3"
    **Method 3: Create a Linux specific package which can be installed using a package manager**

    Now we have to install the firmware package which was saved in the **Downloads** folder in macOS. Copy the package to Linux and follow the instructions below, depending on whether you use `apt`, `dnf` or `rpm`:

    === "apt"

        This package manager is found in Ubuntu, Debian and other similar distros.

        To install using `apt`, run:

        ```bash
        sudo apt install /path/to/firmware_package.deb
        ```

        !!! note

            Replace `/path/to/firmware_package.deb` with the actual path of the package. For example, if `apple-firmware_14.5-1_all.deb` was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be `sudo apt install $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware_14.5-1_all.deb`

    === "dnf"

        This package manager is found in Fedora.

        To install using `dnf`, run:

        ```bash
        sudo dnf install --disablerepo=* /path/to/firmware_package.rpm
        ```

        !!! note

            Replace `/path/to/firmware_package.rpm` with the actual path of the package. For example, if `apple-firmware-14.5-1.noarch.rpm` was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be `sudo dnf install --disablerepo=* $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware-14.5-1.noarch.rpm`

    === "pacman"

        This package manager is found in Arch Linux, EndeavourOS, Manjaro and other similar distros.

        To install using `pacman`, run:

        ```bash
        sudo pacman -U /path/to/firmware_package.pkg.tar.zst
        ```

        !!! note

            Replace `/path/to/firmware_package.pkg.tar.zst` with the actual path of the package. For example, if `apple-firmware-14.5-1-any.pkg.tar.zst` was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be `sudo pacman -U $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware-14.5-1-any.pkg.tar.zst`

=== "Method 4"
    **Method 4: Download a macOS Recovery Image from Apple and extract the firmware from there**

    !!! warning "Internet connection is required for **Method 4**"

        **Method 4** downloads a macOS Recovery image from Apple. So you need to have an active internet connection on Linux. You can use Ethernet, USB tethering or an external Wi-Fi adapter to get internet.
        
    This method does not have any steps to be followed on macOS. So, you have to run the script directly on Linux. After you run the script on Linux, you have to choose the **"Download a macOS Recovery Image from Apple and extract the firmware from there**" option.

    If you choose this method, the script will install the following dependencies, if missing, on Linux:

    1. **curl** - Downloads a [python script](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/blob/master/fetch-macOS-v2.py) which is used to download the macOS Recovery image from Apple.
    2. **dmg2img** - Converts the downloaded macOS Recovery Image to a Linux readable format.

    The script shall automatically detect if any dependency is missing, and if required, will give you the option of installing it. So you need not worry about not having any dependencies installed.

    Once the script confirms that you have the necessary dependencies installed, it shall give you the option to choose which macOS version you wish to download. You must choose **macOS Monterey or later** in order to get complete firmware files. After you choose the desired macOS version, the script should do the rest of the work itself.

## Testing Firmware

You can check the logs to confirm correct loading of the firmware using `sudo journalctl -k --grep=brcmfmac`, the output should look similar to this:

```log

## Fixing unstable WPA2 using iwd

Using iwd is technically not needed for using Wi-Fi. But if you are facing unstable WPA2 issues and have to reload the Wi-Fi driver every time you connect to a WPA2 network, you will have to follow this section. If your connection is stable, you needn't follow this section.

Instructions in this section might be different for the distribution that you are trying to install.

1. To get WPA2 to work stably, install the `iwd` package (for example `sudo apt install iwd` on Ubuntu).

2. Edit `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` to look like the following:

    ```ini
    [device]
    wifi.backend=iwd
    ```

3. Set iwd to run on boot with the following commands (assuming that you are using systemd).

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable --now iwd
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

If you Wi-Fi disconnects or has issues otherwise its advised to restart iwd: `sudo systemctl restart iwd`, or reprobe the Wi-Fi kernel module: `sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac_wcc && sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac && sudo modprobe brcmfmac`.
