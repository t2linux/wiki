For example, if <code>apple-firmware_14.5-1_all.deb</code> was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be <code>sudo apt install $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware_14.5-1_all.deb</code></p> <p>This package manager is found in Fedora.</p> <p>To install using <code>dnf</code>, run:</p> <pre><code>sudo dnf install --disablerepo=* /path/to/firmware_package.rpm\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Replace <code>/path/to/firmware_package.rpm</code> with the actual path of the package. For example, if <code>apple-firmware-14.5-1.noarch.rpm</code> was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be <code>sudo dnf install --disablerepo=* $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware-14.5-1.noarch.rpm</code></p> <p>This package manager is found in Arch Linux, EndeavourOS, Manjaro and other similar distros.</p> <p>To install using <code>pacman</code>, run:</p> <pre><code>sudo pacman -U /path/to/firmware_package.pkg.tar.zst\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Replace <code>/path/to/firmware_package.pkg.tar.zst</code> with the actual path of the package. For example, if <code>apple-firmware-14.5-1-any.pkg.tar.zst</code> was created in macOS and has been copied to the Downloads folder in Linux, command to be run would be <code>sudo pacman -U $HOME/Downloads/apple-firmware-14.5-1-any.pkg.tar.zst</code></p> <p>Method 4: Retrieve the firmware directly from macOS</p> <p>Internet connection may be required for Method 4</p> <p>Method 4 needs certain dependencies to work. If they are missing, you need to have an active internet connection on Linux to download and install them. You can use Ethernet, USB tethering or an external Wi-Fi adapter to get internet. If you are using a customised ISO made for T2 Macs, then most likely those dependencies shall be shipped alongwith the ISO, so in that case internet shall not be required.</p> <p>This method does not have any steps to be followed on macOS. So, you have to run the script directly on Linux. After you run the script on Linux, you have to choose the \"Retrieve the firmware directly from macOS\" option.</p> <p>If you choose this method, the script will install the following dependencies, if missing, on Linux:</p> <ol> <li>APFS driver for Linux - Enables mounting and reading of the partition which has macOS to obtain firmware from there. The source code of the driver which shall be installed by the script is obtained from here.</li> </ol> <p>The script shall automatically detect if any dependency is missing, and if required, will give you the option of installing it. So you need not worry about having missing dependencies.</p> <p>Once the script confirms that you have the necessary dependencies installed, it shall automatically install the firmware.</p> <p>Method 5: Download a macOS Recovery Image from Apple and extract the firmware from there</p> <p>Internet connection is required for Method 5</p> <p>Method 5 downloads a macOS Recovery image from Apple. So you need to have an active internet connection on Linux. You can use Ethernet, USB tethering or an external Wi-Fi adapter to get internet.</p> <p>This method does not have any steps to be followed on macOS. So, you have to run the script directly on Linux. After you run the script on Linux, you have to choose the \"Download a macOS Recovery Image from Apple and extract the firmware from there\" option.</p> <p>If you choose this method, the script will install the following dependencies, if missing, on Linux: </p> <ol> <li>curl - Downloads a python script which is used to download the macOS Recovery image from Apple.</li> <li>dmg2img - Converts the downloaded macOS Recovery Image to a Linux readable format.</li> </ol> <p>The script shall automatically detect if any dependency is missing, and if required, will give you the option of installing it. So you need not worry about having missing dependencies.</p> <p>Once the script confirms that you have the necessary dependencies installed, it shall give you the option to choose which macOS version you wish to download. You must choose macOS Monterey or later in order to get complete firmware files. After you choose the desired macOS version, the script should do the rest of the work itself.</p>"},{"location":"guides/wifi-bluetooth/#testing-firmware","title":"Testing Firmware","text":"<p>You can check the logs to confirm correct loading of the firmware using <code>sudo journalctl -k --grep=brcmfmac</code>, the output should look similar to this:</p> <pre><code>Dec 24 22:34:19 hostname kernel: usbcore: registered new interface driver brcmfmac\nDec 24 22:34:19 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: enabling device (0000 -&gt; 0002)\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac: brcmf_fw_alloc_request: using brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie for chip BCM4377/4\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie.apple,tahiti-SPPR-m-3.1-X0.bin failed with error -2\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie.apple,tahiti-SPPR-m-3.1.bin failed with error -2\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie.apple,tahiti-SPPR-m.bin failed with error -2\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie.apple,tahiti-SPPR.bin failed with error -2\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac4377b3-pcie.apple,tahiti-X0.bin failed with error -2\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac: brcmf_c_process_txcap_blob: TxCap blob found, loading\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac: brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds: Firmware: BCM4377/4 wl0: Jul 16 2021 18:25:13 version 16.20.328.0.3.6.105 FWID 01-30be2b3a\nDec 24 22:34:20 hostname kernel: brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0 wlp1s0f0: renamed from wlan0\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/windows/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This page is a guide on getting Windows and Linux both installed.
